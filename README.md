# Input-Output-File-

This Java project explores the fundamental concepts of file input and output (I/O) by using the Scanner and PrintWriter classes. It illustrates how Java handles the contents of a file as separate tokens, emphasizing the critical role of delimiters in processing text files. In addition, it covers sentinel values, commonly used delimiters, and introduces key Scanner methods like hasNext(), hasNextLine(), next(), and nextLine().
